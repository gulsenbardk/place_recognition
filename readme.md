# Place Recognition Application 

## Description 
This project has been done for Modern C++ Course for Computer Vision on the Geodetic Engineering Master Program, Mobile Sensing and Robotics specilization at University of Bonn in 2024. Homework materials can be found in [course webpage](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/teaching/cpp-2020/homeworks/index.html). Course videos that is taught by Ignacio Vizzo and Prof. Cyrill Stachniss can be found in Prof. Cyrill Stachniss Youtube [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZK6ouwREXA&list=PLgnQpQtFTOGRM59sr3nSL8BmeMZR9GCIA&index=1).

## Data location 

Please locate your images dataset into `"place_recognition/data/images/"`.

## Run application 

When you done compilation please run `./main` to get required html file. 
You can change following attributes in [main.cpp](https://gitlab.igg.uni-bonn.de/s7gubard/place_recognition/-/blob/17bf4dac8f1fc2ea9fbff4fbb3d88a99c7ef64fa/src/main.cpp)
- Image dataset path
- Html saving path
- Size for running kmeans clustering algorithm 
- Maximum iterations for running kmeans clustering algorithm 

*You need to run 3 times to get result html file.*
